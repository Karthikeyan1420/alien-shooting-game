# alien-shooting-game
My game's name is alien shooting game. The main aim is to destroy the aliens and keep moved to the higher levels. In this game the spaceship loaded with many missiles to attack the upcoming aliens. If u destroy the alien, one point will be added to the scorecard. For each destroy, one point will add to your scorecard. N number of aliens will come from the top of the screen, we want to destroy all the aliens by moving the space ship and shooting the aliens. If the alien touches the spaceship, the spaceship will destroy. So we want to destroy the aliens simultaneously protecting our spaceship normally in this game, the keys are collapsed and difficult to move the ship and shoot the aliens. I change the keys(LEFT, RIGHT,UP, DOWN,SPACE) to move the spaceship easily and shoot the enemies. I also include to see the high scores by saving that after the game is over.
